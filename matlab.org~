* Maximizing performance

- use functions instead of scripts
- prefer local functions instead of nested functions - if the functions donot need to access variables in the main function
- use modular programming - split your code into somple and cohesive functions
- preallocate
  - when running for and while loops, incrementing the array size every loop requires matlab to spend extra time looking for larger contiguous blocks of memory, and moving these arrays into these blocks
  - preallocating memory allows the code to be performed faster

** Vectorization vs for loop

- vectorization is faster than a for loop when calculations are applied to a complete array
- when temporary arrays are required, the memory required to store them may reduce the benefits of vectorization
