* Micropore Filling

- for pores with radii less than 15 A, adsorption follows micro-pore filling rather than surface coverage cite:Bering1966
- in pores greater than 15 A, adsorption initially starts as surface coverage mechanism, but later turns into pore filling by capillary condensation mechanism once a threshold relative pressure is reached cite:Bering1966
- adsorption in micropores is a limiting case of the capillary condensation theory cite:Bering1966
