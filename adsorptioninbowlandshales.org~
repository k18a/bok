#+TITLE: Effect of Shale Composition and Pore Structure on Gas Shale Adsorption

* Introduction

- cite:Andrews2013 used adsorption characteristics for it's bottom up estimate of TGIIP, as data was unavailable for Bowland formations

* Methodology

** Sample Description

- shale samples from all prospective stratigraphic units in the Bowland region have been analysed
- samples with a distribution of Total Organic Content and inorganic mineral composition were selected to capture the effect of shale composition on its adsorption characteristics

carbonate - ferroan carbonate

- samples were crushed to a sieve size between 350 \mu m and 2000 \mu m for adsorption measurement
- about 30 ml of the sample was taken for analysis - depending on the density, this corresponds to about 20 - 40 g for different stratigraphic units
- crushed samples were stored in dark under air-tight containers

** Manometric Adsorption Measurement

- time required - 78 days
   
- isotherms were obtained for pressures upto 60 barg

- 4 isotherms were measured for each sample
  - as received
    - 60 degC
      - 5 points were obtained for each sorption curve
      - each point was allowed to reach equilibrium till the adsorption rate fell below 1e-8 mmol/g/hr
      - equilibrium times ranged from nearly 6 hours to about 30 hours at lower pressure steps
      - adsorption profile over time was fitted with kinetic models from literature
      - once an appropriate kinetic model has been established for a given sample, these were used to obtain equilibrium concentrations for subsequent experiments
  - outgassed at 90 degC 100 Torra
    - 30 degC
    - 45 degC
    - 60 degC
  - it's possible for some adsorption to occur between outgassing and the time at which sample is loaded into the sample cell; to minimize this error, outgassing was carried out in situ
  - also, subsequent to outgassing the sample cell was evacuated to about 500 torrs at experimental temperature and allowed to remain till a constant pressure profile was obtained, to standardise the initial state of all samples
  - a lower initial pressure was not used, as the o-rings in the sample cell designed to withstand high pressures, were not as good at preventing leaks at near vacuum
  - pressure profile was collected for 2 hours; kinetic model with the least r square value from the 'as received' sample was used to extrapolate these profiles to find out the equilibrium concentration
  - 7 points were obtained for each sorption curve
  - this amounts to 14 points per sample for both adsorption and desorption curves
     

- negative adsorption values were observed for A114 and MG samples

- void volumes were re-calculated at 95 degC at about 400 Torra to minimize He adsorption

- pore volume accessible to He, but not to CH4 was accounted for using pore volume distribution obtained from N2 adsorption - by removing pore volume less than 0.414 nm from the calulated void volume
