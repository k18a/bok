#+TITLE: Pseudo-Second Order Diffusion Model

- chemical adsortpion maybe second order in a chemical reaction involving a bi-valent species cite:Qiu2009
- called pseudo-second order rate quation to distinguish it from other kinetic equations
- successfully applied to adsorption of bivalent metal ions on dyes, herbicides, oil, and organic substances  
- $\frac{dq_t}{dt} = k_2 * (q_e - q_t)^2$
- integrating with boundary conditions
  - $q_t = 0$ at $t = 0$
  - $q_t = q_t$ at $t = t$
  - $q_t = q_e$ at $t = \infty$
- $\frac{1}{q_e - q_t) = \frac{1}{q_e - q_t} + k_2 t$
  - q_t is amount adsorbed at time t
  - k_2 is pseudo second order rate constant
  - q_e is amount adsorbed at equilibrium
- defining $V_0 = k_2 q_e ^2$
  - V_0 is the initial adsorption rate
- $\frac{t}{q_t} = \frac{1}{V_0} + \frac{1}{q_e} * t$
