* Methodology

- a method of analysis after cite:Rouquerol1994 is adopted
- for all samples, rate of sorption after 2 hours was less than -----
- where experimental equilibrium amount was singnificantly different from modelled equilibrium values, the modelled equilibrium values were chosen to fit adsorption isotherms
- the model with the least mean R squared value accross all pressure steps of a given isotherm was chosen for this purpose

** leak rates

- home-made high pressure adsorption rigs usually have a small leak
- due to the long equilibrium times required for shale adsorption, even small leaks may have a significant effect in adorption calculations; these must be accounted for
- several studies have incorrectly assumed a constant leak rate for all adsorption steps
- leak rate is pressure dependent and must be accounted for using Poiseuille's law, which characterizes fluid flow behaviour in very narrow openings
- hence it's sufficient to measure leak resistance at one sufficiently high pressure, to be able to account for it for the entire adsorption isotherm

- it was noted that leak rates were not constant with time - they varied between various experiments based on the efficiency of the compression fittings used
- it is preferable to characterise leak rates just before starting the experiment
