#+TITLE: Parachor
- parachors are empirical parameters
- parachor of component i can be estimated using the molecular weight of the component M_i and the empirical regression equation
- $P _{chi} = 10.0 + 2.92 M_i$
  - this equation works reasonably well for molecular weights ranging from 100 to 500
