#+TITLE: Second Order Rate Equation

- $\frac{dC_t}{dt} = -k_2 C_t ^2$
- integrating with boundary conditions
  - $C_t = 0$ at t=0
  - $C_t = C_t$ at t=t
- \frac{1}{C_t} = k_2 t + \frac{1}{C_0}
  - C_t is concentration of solute at time t
  - C_0 is initial concentration
  - k_2 is second order rate constant
- have had success in determining flouride adsorption cite:Qiu2009
