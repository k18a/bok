* Social Skills
  
* Conversations
- people engage in conversation with each other for only a very small number of reasons
  - entertainment,
  - information,
  - pleasure,
  - and sometimes all of them at once
- how to take a compliment
  - compliment the compliment
  - complimenting the compliment is more than turning the statement on itself and taking the focus off of you. It allows you to avoid all of the negative implications and assumptions that people would make about how you receive a compliment
