#+TITLE: Petroleum Plays

* Un-conventional Petroleum Plays

** Shales

- shales often comprise the source rock in conventional petroleum plays - hydrocarbons generated in organic rich shales following burial migrate through carrier beds into porous reservoir rocks such as sandstones or carbonates
- in a shale play, shales comprose both the source and the reservoir rock, and thus the target for exploration
- the advent of hydraulic fracturing technology in recent years have allowed for the economic exploitation of shales
