#+TITLE: Porosity

- porosity measured by a given method is the ratio of the total pore volume $V_p$ to the apparent volume V of the particle or powder, excluding interparticle voids, $/epsilon = V_p/V$ cite:Sing1985
- porosity of shales increases when treated with CO2-saturated brine solution due to decomposition of carbonate minerals cite:Lu1995
