* Multilayer Adsorption

- multi-layering occurs when the pressure is sufficiently high (~ 0.1 of the P0) cite:Do1998
- multi-layering is possible in micro-porous substances after the micro-pores are filled cite:Crosdale1998
- physisorption in micropores is limited to very low relative pressures, which is followed by micropore filling at intermediate relative pressures, before the onset of capillary condensation or multilayer adsorption at external surfaces at higher relative pressure cite:Sing1985
- if the isotherm plateau at higher relative pressures is virtually horizontal, multilayer adsorption on external surfaces is negligible cite:Sing1985
