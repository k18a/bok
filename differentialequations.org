* Partial Differential Equations

- involves more than one independent variable, so that the derivatives occurring in it are partial derivatives

* Non Linear Differential Equations

Conditions for linearity

- superposition principle: $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$
- homogeneity: $f(cx,cy)=c^kf(x,y)$

Non-Linear Function

- a function in which the change of the output variable is not proportional to the change of the input
- non-linear functions are often approximated by linearization to allow them to be solved easily
- examples of non-linear differential equations include the [navierstokes](navierstokes) and [
