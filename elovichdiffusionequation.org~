#+TITLE: Elovich's Diffusion Equation

- used primarily for chemisorption in heterogeneous solids cite:Qiu2009
- $\frac{dq}{dt} = a * e ^(-\alpha q)$ cite:Qiu2009 
  - q is amount adsorbed at time t
  - a is desorption constant
  - \alpha is initial adsorption rate
- linear form of the equation is given as cite:Qiu2009
- $q = (\frac{2.3}{\alpha}) * log (t + t_0) - (\frac{2.3}{\alpha}) log t_0$
  - $t_0 = \frac{1}{\alpha a}$
- with the assumption of $a\alpha >> 1$ and boundary conditions
  - $q=0$ at $t=0$
  - $q=q$ at $t=t$
- $q = \alpha ln(a \alpha) + \alpha ln t$
