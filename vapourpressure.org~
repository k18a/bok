* Vapour Pressure

* Saturation Vapour Pressure for adsorption

- saturation Vapour Pressure has been obtained through 
  - a plot of log(vapour pressure) vs 1/T cite:Clarkson1997
  - from Chemical Engineering data books cite:Lide2003
  - from reduced Kirchoff equation cite:Kapoor1989
    - $P _s = P _c * exp[ \frac{T _{nbp}}{T _c} (\frac{ln P _c}{1 - T _{nbp}/T _c})(1 - \frac{T _c}{T}) ]$
- cite:Clarkson1997 found that pseudo vapour pressures obtained from CRC handbook and Kirchoff equation provided the best results.
