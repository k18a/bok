#+TITLE: Equations of State

* Equations of State in Shale Adsorption

- the choice of equation of state, greatly affects calculated adsorption values
  - whilst conventional equations such as Peng-Robinson and Redlich-Kwong are widely used, more precise EoS specific for individual gases have been proposed in the recent years.
- it is challenging to find an EoS that adequately describes adsorption at near critical regions cite:Siemons2007
