#+TITLE: van der Waals Equation of State

* van der Waals Equation of State

- takes into account the effect of molecular size and inter-molecular forces

$[P + a (\frac{n}{V})^2] (\frac{V}{n} - b) = RT$

- constants a and b are characteristic of the gas being modeled 
- a accounts for intermolecular forces
- b accounts for finite molecular size, and is the volume of one mole of the atom or molecule
- van der Waals EoS approaches ideal gas law as these constants approach 0
