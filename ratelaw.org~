#+TITLE: Rate Laws

** Rate of a Reaction

- a rate law describes the relationship between reactant rates and reactant concentrations
- reactant rates are usually expressed as concentration of reactant consumed or concentration of products formed per unit time
  - $rate = \frac{\Delta[reactant]}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta[product]}{\Delta t}$

- instantaneous rate of a reaction is the raction rate a any given point in time 
  - reaction rate approaches the instantaneous reaction rate as the measurement time becomes smaller and smaller

** Order of a Reaction

- reaction rates maybe dependent on specific interactions between reactant molecules the phases in which the reaction takes place etc.

* Zero Order Reaction Kinetics
  
- example: a reaction mediated by a catalyst present in small amounts
- consider a closed container initially filled with chemical species A
- $a A \rightarrow b B$
- $c_A = -kt + c_i$
- where c_i is initial concentration
- at $t=0$, $[A] = [A]_0$
- $c_A = [A]_0 - kt$
- a plot of concentration against time yeilds a straight line with a slope of -k and an intercept of [A]_0

* First Order Reaction Kinetics

** Pseudo-First Order Diffusion Model

- earliest model pertaining to adsorption rate based on adsorption capacity
- called pseudo first order equation to distinguish it from kinetic equations
- initially proposed by Lagergren in 1898
- $\frac{dq_t}{dt} = k_1 * (q_e - q_t)$
  - q_t is amount adsorbed at time t
  - k_2 is pseudo second order rate constant
  - q_e is amount adsorbed at equilibrium
- with boundary conditions:
  - $q_t = 0$ at $t = 0$
  - $q_t = q_t$ at $t = t$
- with boundary conditions
  - $q_t = q_0$ at $t = 0$
  - $q_t = q_t$ at $t = t$
- $q_t = q_e - q_e exp(-k_1 t) + q_0 exp(-k_1 t)$
- $ln(\frac{q_e}{q_e - q_t}) = k_1 t$
- linear form 
- $log(q_e - q_t) = log(q_e) - \frac{k_1}{2.303} * t$
- k_1 can be calculated from a linear plot of $log(q_e - q_t)$ agains t
- k_1 is directly proportional to the rate of adsorption

* Second Order Reaction Kinetics
- $\frac{dC_t}{dt} = -k_2 C_t ^2$
- integrating with boundary conditions
  - $C_t = 0$ at t=0
  - $C_t = C_t$ at t=t
- \frac{1}{C_t} = k_2 t + \frac{1}{C_0}
  - C_t is concentration of solute at time t
  - C_0 is initial concentration
  - k_2 is second order rate constant

** Pseudo Second Order Diffusion Model
- have had success in determining flouride adsorption cite:Fan2003a
- chemical adsortpion maybe second order in a chemical reaction involving a bi-valent species cite:Qiu2009
- called pseudo-second order rate quation to distinguish it from other kinetic equations
- successfully applied to adsorption of bivalent metal ions on dyes, herbicides, oil, and organic substances  
- $\frac{dq_t}{dt} = k_2 * (q_e - q_t)^2$
- integrating with boundary conditions
  - $q_t = 0$ at $t = 0$
  - $q_t = q_t$ at $t = t$
- $\frac{1}{q_e - q_t} = \frac{1}{q_e - q_t} + k_2 t$
  - q_t is amount adsorbed at time t
  - k_2 is pseudo second order rate constant
  - q_e is amount adsorbed at equilibrium
- integrating with boundary conditions
  - $q_t = q_0$ at $t = 0$
  - $q_t = q_t$ at $t = t$
- $q_t = \frac{k _2 t q _e ^2 - k _2 q _0 t q_e + q _0}{k _2 q _e t - k _2 q _0 t + 1}$
  - q_t is amount adsorbed at time t
  - k_2 is pseudo second order rate constant
  - q_e is amount adsorbed at equilibrium
  - q_0 is amount adsorbed at time 0
- defining $V_0 = k_2 q_e ^2$
  - V_0 is the initial adsorption rate
- linear form
- $\frac{t}{q_t} = \frac{1}{V_0} + \frac{1}{q_e} * t$
- k_2 can be found by plotting $\frac{t}{q_t}$ agains t
- k_2 is inversely proportional to the rate of adsorption
