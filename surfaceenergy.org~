#+TITLE: Surface Energy

- occurs in all interfaces between two phases
- surface energy is the excess energy at the surface of a material compared to the bulk
- surfaces are intrinsically less energetically favourable than the bulk of a material
- surface energy quantifies the disruption of intermolecular bonds that occur when a surface is created
  - work required to cut a bulk sample creating two surfaces
- if the creation of surface is reversible, cutting a solid to give two surfaces implies that surface energy is half the energy of cohesion
  - this is true only for freshly prepared surfaces in vacuum
