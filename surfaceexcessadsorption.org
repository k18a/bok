#+TITLE: Surface Excess Adsorption

* Definitions

* Gibbs Dividing Surface
- the Gibbs Dividing Surface (GDS) is an arbirtary geometrical surface close to the adsorbing surface, with a precisely determined position
  - it is assumed that adsorption takes place on the GDS

** Gibbs Exclusion Volume
- Gibbs Exclusion Volume $V_{GDS}$ is the volume excluded by the GDS cite:Rouquerol2016
  - by declaring such a variable, it is possible to exclude the uncertainties posed by void volume calculations from the surface excess amount
  - but this also means that the Gibbs Exclusion Volume must be reported along with the surface excess for it to be comparable  
    
** Choice of the GDS
- due to practical limitations are limited to the following cite:Rouquerol2016
  - a probe-determined $V_{GDS}$ close to the adsorbent specific volume $V _i ^s$ for vapour adsorption below 1 bar
  - an arbirtray $V_{GDS}$ of 0.5 cm3/g, which is close enough to the specific volume of many adsorbents
  - $V_{GDS}$ of 0, yeilds net adsorption, particularly useful for evaluating gas storage

* Specific Volume of the Sample
- dead volume is the volume available to the gas phase cite:Rouquerol2016
  - $V _i ^g = V - ( V _i ^S + V _i ^a)$
  - V is the sum of the volume of the empty adsorption bulb + the dosing volume up to the membrane of the pressure transducer
    - $V _i ^S$ is the adsorbent volume inaccessible to the molecules of the adsorptive i - the solid volume
    - $V _i ^a$ is the volume of the adsorption space for the adsorptive i - the adsoptive volume
  - the usual method of void volume characterization is based on gas expansion using Helium, which is assumed to inert  
    - it is now well known that He is, however, prone, to adsorption in micropores, leading to disproprtionately large void volumes and disproportionately small values for adsorption cite:Rouquerol2016
    - He absorption might also be appreciable for shales, especially at moisture equilibrated conditions
    - this effect maybe minimized by measuring dead volume at higher temperatures cite:Rouquerol2016 
    - due to their dimensions, some of these pores might be inaccessible to larger adsorptive molecules.
    - these shortcomings can be in principle avoided by calculating void volume through gas expansion of the adsorptive molecules at a tempreature where adsorption is negligible, but this is not always practically possible cite:Rouquerol2016
    - in simulations, the dead volume is calculated using an r-distance surface, the volume limited by the probe-accessible surface - the connolly surface for spherical probes cite:Rouquerol2016

* Adsorption Space
- adsorption space is $V _i ^a$ defined as the region in which the concentration of the adsorptive is higher compared to the bulk region or the gas phase cite:Rouquerol2016
  - for the sake of simplicity, the adsorption space is often taken as 0 cite:Rouquerol2016
  - adsorbed phase volume, $V _i ^a$ can either cite:Rouquerol2016
    - be assumed to be equal to the micropore volume - with increasing density with loading, or
    - be assumed to have a constant density and increasing volume with loading

- amount adsorbed is defined as the content of the adsorption space cite:Rouquerol2016

* Excess Adsorption
- the resulting surface excess amount is given as: cite:Rouquerol2016
  - $n _\sigma = n - c^g (V - V _{GDS})$
    - n is the total adsorptive introduced into the system
    - cg is the final experimental concentration of the gas phase
    - $V _{GDS} is the gibbs exclusion volume that is decided by the coice of the GDS
  - it must be noted that most porous solids do not have a well defined adospriton surface, and hence the defenition of a Gibbs surface excess is not valid in most cases; however the concept of a surface excess amount can be an useful intermediate step in calculating  amount adsorbed.
    - in adsorbates containing micropores less than 2 nm, dead volume of the gas phase is not very easy to measure.
    - a straight line or plane assumed to be the GDS cannot conicde with the more complex shape of the adsorptive-accessibe surface of the adsorbent.
    - it can be seen that for different arbitrary GDS positions, the excess adsorbed, $n _{\sigma}$, calculated varies accordingly
      - the space represented by the yellow rectangle is the portion of gas counted as gas
      - where $n^a$ is the absolute adsorption
      - $n ^{\sigma} = n^a - n^c - n^b$ for GDS-1
      - $n ^{\sigma} = n^a - n^c$ for GDS-2
      - $n ^{\sigma} = n^a + n^d$ for GDS-3

* Net Adsorption
- net adsorption is calculated from a $V_{GDS}$ of 0 cite:Rouquerol2016

* Absolute Adsorption
- calculation of absolute adsorption requires knowledge of cite:Rouquerol2016
  - $V_{GDS}$ used to calculate $n ^{\sigma}$
  - gas law used the calculation of $n ^{\sigma}$ to derive $c ^g$
  - specific inaccessible volume of the adsorbent $V _i ^s$
  - actual volume of the adsorbate $V _i ^a$
- $$n ^a = n ^{\sigma} + c ^g V ^a + c ^g ( V _i ^S - V _{GDS} )$$ cite:Rouquerol2016

** Adsorbed Phase Volume / Density Correction Term
- $c ^g V ^a$
- second term in the equation for absolute adsorption corrects the assumption of 0 adsorption volume in the Gibbs approach
  - for sub-critical adsorption below 1 bar this term might be ignored
  - but this term becomes significant for adsorption above 10 bars and for super-critical adsorption

** Void Volume Correction Term
- $c ^g ( V _i ^S - V _{GDS} )$
- thrid term accounts for the fact that GDS does not coincide with the adsorbing surface accessible to the adsorbate
- can be ignored for low pressures due to low values fo $c ^g$
  - for high pressure adsorption, due to an increased value of $c ^g$, small errors in $V _i ^s$ and $V _i ^a$ lead to a significant error in amount adsorbed
- for vapour adsorption at low pressures, below 1 bar, the difference between excess and absolute adsopriton is negligible. 

* Equations of State
- the choice of equation of state, greatly affects calculated adsorption values
  - whilst conventional equations such as Peng-Robinson and Redlich-Kwong are widely used, more precise EoS specific for individual gases have been proposed in the recent years.
- it is challenging to find an EoS that adequately describes adsorption at near critical regions cite:Siemons2007

* Saturation Vapour Pressure
- saturation Vapour Pressure has been obtained through 
  - a plot of log(vapour pressure) vs 1/T cite:Clarkson1997
  - from Chemical Engineering data books cite:Lide2003
  - from reduced Kirchoff equation cite:Kapoor1989
    - $P _s = P _c * exp[ \frac{T _{nbp}}{T _c} (\frac{ln P _c}{1 - T _{nbp}/T _c})(1 - \frac{T _c}{T}) ]$
- cite:Clarkson1997 found that pseudo vapour pressures obtained from CRC handbook and Kirchoff equation provided the best results.

* Gravimetric Adsorption
- in gravimetric measurements, the effect of weight increase due to adsorption is reduced due to bouyancy, proportional to gas density $\rho _i ^g$ cite:Rouquerol2016
- excess adsorbed is given as:
  - $n ^{\sigma} = \frac{\Delta m + \Delta \rho _i ^g (V _{GDS} + V ^B)}{M_i}$
    - for gravimetric measurements, $c ^g$ can be replaced by $\rho _i ^g$ / M_i$
    - $\Delta m$ is the measured mass change
    - $\rho _i ^g$ is the gas phase density
    - $V _{GDS}$ is the Gibbs exclusion volume
    - $V ^B$ is the volume of the gas phase
    - $M _i$ is the molar mass of the adsorptive
- absolute adsorbed is given as
  - $n ^a = n ^{\sigma} + (\frac{\Delta \rho _i ^g}{M _i}) V _i ^a + (\frac{\Delta \rho _i ^g}{M _i})*(V _i ^s - V_{GDS})$
    - $V _i ^a$ is the volume of the adsorbed phase
