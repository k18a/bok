#+TITLE: Bi-disperse Diffusion Model

- bi-disperse model was originally proposed by cite:Ruckenstein1971
- bi-disperse solids maybe obtained through several processes 
  - when finely divided particles are tableted or pelletized, the resultant product has both micropores and macropores cite:Ruckenstein1971
  - when shales are hydraulically fractured, or in the presence of larger natural fractures in microporous shales cite:Crosdale1998
- the model assumes a bimodal pore size distribution 
  - with macropores and micropores, and no adsorption in macropores cite:Ruckenstein1971 
- $\frac{V_t}{V_{\infty}} = \frac { \sum _{k=1}^{\infty} \sum _{k=1}^{\infty} \frac {k^2 [1 - exp(-\alpha {\epsilon} _{qk}^2 \tau)]} { {\epsilon} _{qk}^4 [ \frac {\alpha}{\beta} + 1 + cot^2 {\epsilon _{qk} } - (1 - \frac{k^2 {\pi}^2} {\beta}){\frac{1}{{\epsilon} _{qk}^{2}}} ] } } { \sum _{k=1}^{\infty} \sum _{k=1}^{\infty} \frac {k^2} { \epsilon _{qk}^4 [ \frac {\alpha}{\beta} + 1 + cot^2 {\epsilon _{qk} } - (1 - \frac{k^2 {\pi}^2} {\beta}){\frac{1}{{\epsilon} _{qk}^{2}}} ] } }$
- this equation maybe simplified based on whether the macropore or micropore diffusion determines the overall rate of diffusion cite:Crosdale1998
- this is determined by the parameter $\alpha$:
  - 1) for $\alpha < 10 ^{-3}$ micro-pore diffusion is the rate determining step;
  - 2) for $10 ^{-3} < \alpha < 10 ^2$, both macro-pore and micro-pore diffusion are important; and
  - 3) for $\alpha > 10^2$, macro-pore diffusion is the rate determining step 
- the parameter $\beta / \alpha$ represents the ratio of micro-pore and macro-pore uptakes at equilibrium: small values indicate dominant macro-pore uptake and larger values indicate dominant micro-pore uptake cite:Crosdale1998
- macropore transport was initially dominant after a step change in pressure, after which micropore transport was more pronounced cite:Clarkson1999; this observation was also consistent with reservoir simulations by cite:Gamson1996
