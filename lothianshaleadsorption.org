#+TITLE: A Critical Review of Experimental and Theoretical Assumptions Involved in Manometric Adsorption Characterization of Gas Shales and their Net Effects on Reserve Estimation and Production Forecasts

* Methodology

- a method of analysis after cite:Rouquerol1994 is adopted
- for all samples, rate of sorption after 2 hours was less than -----
- where experimental equilibrium amount was singnificantly different from modelled equilibrium values, the modelled equilibrium values were chosen to fit adsorption isotherms
- the model with the least mean R squared value accross all pressure steps of a given isotherm was chosen for this purpose

* Assumptions on Void Volume

- a specific volume of 0.5 cc/g might be too high for most gas shales, whose typical densities range between ----

* Assumptions on leak rates

- home-made high pressure adsorption rigs usually have a small leak
- due to the long equilibrium times required for shale adsorption, even small leaks may have a significant effect in adorption calculations; these must be accounted for
- several studies have incorrectly assumed a constant leak rate for all adsorption steps
- leak rate is pressure dependent and must be accounted for using Poiseuille's law, which characterizes fluid flow behaviour in very narrow openings
- hence it's sufficient to measure leak resistance at one sufficiently high pressure, to be able to account for it for the entire adsorption isotherm

- it was noted that leak rates were not constant with time - they varied between various experiments based on the efficiency of the compression fittings used
- it is preferable to characterise leak rates just before starting the experiment

  
* Assumptions on Kinetic Models

- it was noted that most of the sorption occured within a few fractions of a seconds
- kinetic models were fit using a modified least squares approach, providing more weight to data points with smaller time scales
  - possibly take R^2 * t as the error instead of R^2?
