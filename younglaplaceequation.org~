#+TITLE: Young-Laplace Equation

- non-linear partial differential equation
- describes capillary pressure difference sustained across the interface between two static fluids due to the phenomenon of surface tension
- relates pressure difference to the shape of the surface or wall and is fundamental to the study of static capillary surfaces
