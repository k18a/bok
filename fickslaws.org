#+TITLE: Fick's Laws

* Fick's Laws
  
** Fick's First Law:
- defines mass flux with respect to distance
- first law for cartesian co-ordinates
  - $$J = - A * D * \frac{\partial C}{\partial z}$$
  - J is flux per unit area
  - A is area accross which diffusion occurs
  - C is concentration
  - z is distance
  - D is diffusion coefficient
** Fick's Second Law: 
- a more general conservation equation that gives change in concentration with time
  - $$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D * \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial r^2} = D (\frac{\partial ^2 C}{\partial z ^2} + \frac{1}{A} + \frac{\partial A}{\partial z} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z})$$
  - t is time
- For a non-linear isotherm cite:Clarkson1999
  - $$\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (D {\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}}) = \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}$$

* Diffusion Constant
- much less sensitive to temperature than the rate constant of a chemical reaction or other phenomena
- also much less sensitive to the solute being studied, diffusion constant in a given system for a variety of solutes often fall within a factor of 10
- also much less sensitive to solute concentration, although there are exceptions
  - smaller solutes may show concentration dependent diffusion
