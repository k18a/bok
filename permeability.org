#+TITLE: Permeability

- the use of CO2 based fracturing fluids can minimise reduction in formation permeability due to water imbibition cite:Lu2016
- permeability of shales can increase when treated with CO2-saturated brine solution at hydraulic fracturing conditions due to the decomposition of carbonate minerals cite:Lu2016
