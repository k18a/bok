@article{Hettema2012,
abstract = {Henry Eyring's absolute rate theory explains the size of chemical reaction rate constants in terms of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and quantum chemistry. In addition it uses a number of unique concepts such as the ‘transition state'. A key feature of the theory is that the explanation it provides relies on the comparison of reaction rate constant expressions derived from these individual theories. In this paper, the example is used to develop a naturalized notion of reduction and the unity of science. This characterization provides the necessary clues to the sort of inter-theoretic linkages that are present in the theory of reaction rates. The overall theory is then further characterized as a theory network, establishing connections between non-reductive notions of inter-theory connections. This characterization also sheds new light on the unity of science.},

@article{Weber1963a,
abstract = {Laboratory investigations show that rates of adsorption of persistent organic compounds on granular carbon are quite low. Intraparticle diffusion of solute appears to control the rate of uptake, thus the rate is partially a function of the pore size distribution of the adsorbent, of the molecular size and configuration of the solute, and of the relative electrokinetic properties of adsorbate and adsorbent. Systemic factors such as temperature and pH will influence the rates of adsorption; rates increase with increasing temperature and decrease with increasing pH. The effect of initial concentration of solute is of considerable significance, the rate of uptake being a linear function of the square-root of concentration within the range of experimentation. Relative reaction rates also vary reciprocally with the square of the diameter of individual carbon particle for a given weight of carbon. Based on the findings of the research, fluidized-bed operation is suggested as an efficient means of using adsorption for treatment of waters and waste waters.},

@article{Andrews2013,
abstract = {Marine shales were deposited in a complex series of tectonically active basins across central Britain during the Visean and Namurian epochs of the Carboniferous (c.347-318 Ma). In all of these basins, deep-water marine shales pass laterally into shallow-water shelf limestones and deltaic sandstones. Contemporary basins extend offshore beneath the East Irish Sea and the Southern North Sea. The marine shales attain thicknesses of up to 16,000 ft (5000 m) in basin depocentres (i.e. the Bowland, Blacon, Gainsborough, Widmerpool, Edale and Cleveland basins), and they contain sufficient organic matter to generate considerable amounts of hydrocarbons. Conventional oil and gas fields around most of these basins attest to their capability to produce hydrocarbons. The organic content of the Bowland-Hodder shales is typically in the range 1-3{\%}, but can reach 8{\%}. The maturity of the Bowland-Hodder shales is a function of burial depth, heat flow and time, but subsequent uplift complicates this analysis. Where they have been buried to sufficient depth for the organic material to generate gas, the Bowland-Hodder shales have the potential to form a shale gas resource.},

@article{Loucks2012,
abstract = {Matrix-related pore networks in mudrocks are composed of nanometer- to micrometer-size pores. In shale-gas systems, these pores, along with natural fractures, form the flow-path (permeability) network that allows flow of gas from the mudrock to induced fractures during production. A pore classification consisting of three majormatrix-related pore types is presented that can be used to quantify matrix-related pores and relate them to pore networks. Two pore types are associated with the mineral matrix; the third pore type is associated with organic matter (OM). Fracture pores are not controlled by individual matrix particles and are not part of this classification. Pores associated with mineral particles can be subdivided into interparticle (interP) pores that are found between particles and crystals and intraparticle (intraP) pores that are located within particles. Organic-matter pores are intraP pores located within OM. Interparticle mineral pores have a higher probability of being part of an effective pore network than intraP mineral pores because they are more likely to be interconnected. Although they are intraP, OM pores are also likely to be part of an interconnected network because of the interconnectivity of OM particles. In unlithifed near-surface muds, pores consist of interP and intraP pores, and as the muds are buried, they compact and lithify. During the compaction process, a large number of interP and intraP pores are destroyed, especially in ductile grainrich muds. Compaction can decrease the pore volume up to 88{\%} by several kilometers of burial. At the onset of hydrocarbon thermal maturation, OM pores are created in kerogen. At depth, dissolution of chemically unstable particles can create additional moldic intraP pores},

abstract = {Division of the finest pores of adsorbents with equivalent radii r up to 15-16 A into micro-pores with r {\textless} 6-7 A and supermicropores (large micropores) with r {\textgreater} 6-7 A is proposed. The theory of volume filling refers exclusively to micropores. The micropore analysis method (MP-method) is used only for supermicropores. The distinguishing features of super-micropores as a transitional region of porosity between micropores and mesopores are noted. It is shown that there are no quantitative criteria for estimating the physical feasibility of the results of application of the t-and the MP-methods to supermicroporous adsorbents. The question as to the degree of agreement between the parameters of the porous structure of supermicroporous adsorbents obtained by the MP-method and the real ones remains open. I N T R O D U C T I O N Experimental and theoretical investigations into the physical adsorption of gases and vapors on adsorbents with pores commensurate with the size of molecules adsorbed have led to the conception of a cardinal difference between this limiting case of adsorption and adsorption on nonporous or relatively large-pore adsorb-ents (1-5). Such pores were named micropores (6), and adsorbents with a predominant volume of micropores in the total sorption volmne, microporous (7). The commensura-bility of the micropores of active carbons and molecules adsorbed has been indicated by molecular-sieve effects in adsorption of dis-solved substances with various sizes of mole-cules (6), which permitted arranging adsorb-ents in the order of increasing sizes of micro-pores. Later on, micropore sizes were estimated by the small-angle X-ray scattering method (8). As a result it was found that microporous carbon adsorbents and synthetic zeolites typical for our stidies had micropores whose equivalent radii for the cylindrical model did not exceed 6-7 A. These adsorbents did not possess, in measurable amounts, larger pores up to the smallest mesopores (transitional pores) with equivalent radii greater than 15-16 3,. Recently, it has been proved by direct experiments that the above-mentioned typical micropores are commensurate with molecules adsorbed (9). The experimental data obtained in these investigations served as a basis for the theory of volume filling of micropores. At a later date it was shown that for maxi-mally activated carbons (10-12) and fine-pore silica gels (13) a wider pore distribution is observed in which pores with equivalent radii of 6-7 to 15-16 A are represented.

abstract = {Abstract In order to increase the oil recovery factor from depleted sandstone reservoirs with low degree of pressure, implementation of chemical flooding is the technically known as a feasible solution. The polymer-surfactant flooding, as one of the main subsets of chemical flooding methods, is a vigorous Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method which can be applied with a high level of performance in sandstone reservoirs. Applying the aforementioned technique is very often unfeasible due to the expensive chemical additives and surfactant loss in term of adsorption on the reservoir rock. This paper mainly deals with the adsorption behavior (both static and dynamic) of the natural surfactant, which extracted surfactant from leaves of Zyziphus Spina Christi, onto a real shale-sandstone reservoir samples. Furthermore, adsorption kinetics and equilibrium are determined to help the understanding of the adsorption mechanism. To examine the effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption efficiency, static adsorption experiments are performed. The effect of temperature on the kinetic and equilibrium of adsorption process was experimentally done. Finally, two core flooding experiments are carried out to determine the adsorption behavior in dynamic conditions. It was emerged that the Freundlich model has a more permissible fit for the adsorption equilibrium of natural surfactant after analyzing the related data for four models. Moreover, the laboratorial research about the adsorption kinetics proved statistically that pseudo-second order model prepares the best kinetics model for the natural surfactant.},

In the present work, a general two-dimensional equation of state (2-D EOS) is presented and the fugacity equations are derived to describe the adsorbed phase for adsorption from gas mixtures. Model constants in the 2-D EOS are determined from pure adsorption equilibria data and then used to predict adsorption of mixtures on both homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces. The 2-D van der Waals, Soave-Redlich-Kwong, Peng-Robinson, Eyring as well as a new 2-D EOS are evaluated for systems which include both ideal and nonideal adsorption behaviors. The predictions are compared with those of other methods, including the Langmuir model and ideal adsorbed solution theory. Various forms of the 2-D EOS are found to be capable of representing azeotropic behavior, and they provide overall the best predictive results (when based on information from pure-component isotherms). {\textcopyright} 1994 American Chemical Society.},

@inproceedings{Ambrose2010,
abstract = {Using FIB/SEM imaging technology, a series of 2-D and 3-D submicro-scale investigations are performed on the types of porous constituents inherent to gas shale. A finely-dispersed porous organic (kerogen) material is observed imbedded within an inorganic matrix. The latter may contain larger-size pores of varying geometries although it is the organic material that makes up the majority of gas pore volume, with pores and capillaries having characteristic lengths typically less than 100 nanometers. A significant portion of total gas in-place appears to be associated with inter-connected large nano-pores within the organic material. This observation has several implications on reservoir engineering of gas shales. Primarily, thermodynamics (phase behavior) of fluids in these pores are known to be quite different. Most importantly, gas residing in a small pore or capillary is rarefied under the influence of organic pore walls and shows a density profile across the pore with damped-oscillations. This raises the following serious questions related to gas-in-place calculations: under reservoir conditions, what fraction of the pore volume of the organic material can be considered available for the free gas phase and what fraction is taken up by the adsorbed phase? If a significant fraction of the organic pore volume is taken up by the adsorbed phase, how accurately is the shale gas storage capacity estimated using the conventional volumetric methods? And, finally, do average densities exist for the free and the adsorbed phases and how large would a typical density contrast be in an organic pore for an accurate gas reserve calculation? In order to answer these questions we combine the Langmuir equilibrium adsorption isotherm with the volumetrics for free gas and formulate a new gas-in-place equation accounting for the organic pore space taken up by the sorbed phase. The method yields a total gas-in-place prediction based on a corrected free gas pore volume that is obtained using an average adsorbed gas density. Next, we address the fundamental-level questions related to phase transition in organic matter using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations involving methane in small carbon slit-pores of varying size and temperature. We predict methane density profiles across the pores and show that (i) an average total thickness for an adsorbed methane layer is typically 0.7 nm, which is roughly equivalent to 4{\%} of a 100 nm diameter pore volume, and (ii) the adsorbed phase density is 1.8-2.0 times larger than that of the bulk methane, i.e., in the absence of pore wall effects. These findings suggest that a significant level of adjustment is necessary in volume calculations, especially for gas shales high in total organic content. Finally, using typical values for the parameters, we perform a series of calculations using the new volumetric method and show a 10-25{\%} decrease in total gas storage capacity compared to that using the conventional approach. This additionally could have a larger impact in shales where the sorbed gas phase is a more significant portion of the total gas-in-place. The new methodology is recommended for estimating shale gas-in-place and the approach could be extended to other unconventional gas-in-place calculations where both sorbed and free gas phases are present.

abstract = {The methane isothermal adsorption experiment was conducted on the Lower Silurian marine shale of the Longmaxi Formation from the Upper Yangtze Platform, China, at pressures up to 10.94 MPa and temperatures of 30 °C and 39 °C to investigate the key factors affecting its methane adsorption capacity. Basic shale reservoir characteristics were obtained using total organic carbon measurements, thermal maturity assessment, X-ray diffraction, and nitrogen adsorption. An abundance of organic matter in the reservoir with total organic carbon (TOC) ranging between 0.49 and 4.8 wt{\%} was overmature. The matrix minerals mainly consisted of clay (16{\%}–33{\%}) and quartz (37{\%}–53.9{\%}). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the shale samples varied from 6.34 to 21.3 m2/g. The Langmuir-based absolute adsorption model was used to correct the measured adsorption isotherms into absolute adsorption isotherms, which represented the actual adsorption. Furthermore, the Langmuir volume was in the range of 1.04–5.36 m3/t. Shale gas adsorption capacity presented a significantly positive correlation with an abundance of organic matter that provided a larger BET surface area. The absence of apparent correlation with the clay indicated that the clay did not significantly contribute to the gas adsorption capacity in the shale samples. Variations in temperature and pressure were also key factors affecting shale gas adsorption capacity. Therefore, TOC, temperature, and pressure were optimized to establish the forecast model, combined with multiple regression methods and a set of cited data. The results of the isothermal adsorption experiment in this study were used to verify the model's feasibility for predicting the shale gas adsorption capacity of the Longmaxi Formation. The predicted results were highly correlated with the actual measured results, with a correlation coefficient as high as 0.9887. The function of shale gas adsorption capacity derived and analyses employed in this study can be used to illustrate the impact of pressure and temperature regimes on shale gas adsorption capacity, given varying abundance of organic matter and compositions of matrix minerals.},

abstract = {Calculations are presented of the potential energy profiles for atoms adsorbed in slit-like pores, and of the enhancement of the depth of the potential energy well compared with that for adsorption by a single surface. The vibrational frequency normal to the wall is calculated as a function of slit width and methods of analysing experimental data are suggested. A comparison is made with similar expressions for adsorption in cylindrical pores. Recently published data on the adsorption of noble gases by a series of microporous carbons is analysed and shown to be best represented in terms of slit-like pores having an average width (between the nuclei of carbon atoms) of about 0.77 nm. The width available to an adsorbed molecule is about 0.52 nm which is in quantitative agreement with the known molecular sieve properties of these carbons. A well-activated carbon has pores with a somewhat larger mean width. The calculated vibration frequencies lie in the range 5-10 x 10" Hz. The calculated surface areas and micropore volumes are 3-4 times smaller than the " monolayer equivalent areas " and pore volumes derived from micropore adsorption of nitrogen and benzene. It is concluded, in agreement with Dubinin, that the micropore volume can be divided into ultra-micropores, consisting of 25-30 {\%} of the total micropore volume having free widths of about 0.52 nm, together with supermicropores which are larger and are filled with adsorbed vapour only at higher relative pressures.},

@article{Fan2003a,
abstract = {Adsorption is one important technique in fluoride removal from aqueous solutions. The viability of adsorption techniques is greatly dependent on the development of adsorptive materials. A large number of materials have been tested at a fluoride concentration greater than 2mg/l, and the lowest limit for fluoride reduction by them is about 2mg/l. Decreasing the fluoride concentration to less than 2mg/l, most of the tested materials displayed a very low capacity of fluoride removal. This paper has concentrated on investigating the adsorption kinetics and adsorption capacity of low cost materials at a low initial fluoride concentration. The experiments were carried out at a natural pH, and radioisotope18F rather than19F was used since18F can be rapidly measured by measuring the radioactivity with a resolution of 1×10-13mg or 0.01$\mu$Ci. The tested materials are hydroxyapatite, fluorspar, calcite, quartz and quartz activated by ferric ions. Their adsorption capacities follow the order: Hydroxyapatite{\textgreater} Fluorspar{\textgreater}Quartz activated using ferric ions{\textgreater}Calcite{\textgreater}Quartz The uptake of fluoride on hydroxyapatite is an ion-exchange procedure and follows the pseudo-first- and second-order equations, while the uptake of fluoride on the others is a surface adsorption and follows the pseudo-second-order equation. Calcite has been seen as a good adsorbent in fluoride removal and has been patented. However, our data suggested that its adsorption capacity is only better than quartz. The external mass transfer is a very slow and rate-determining step during fluoride removal from the aqueous solution. Under static conditions, there was no relative movement between adsorbents and solutions, the fluoride uptake was at a very slow rate and the adsorbent properties did not significantly affect the fluoride uptake. Under shaken conditions, the adsorption of fluoride was controlled by the adsorbent structure and chemical properties. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Bowland Basin is a key part of the Pennine Carboniferous Petroleum system is calculated to have significant shale gas resource potential with over 200 TCF OGIP The basin is one of a number of linked, Lower Carboniferous trans-tensional basins characterized by thick accumulations of hemi-pelagic calcareous mudstones and related facies. In Bowland there is up to 2000m of gas saturated section comprising the Hodder, Lower Bowland and Upper Bowland Shale Formations. This paper will describe the results of recent exploration activity by Cuadrilla Resources Ltd between 2010 and 2012. These include the gas discovery well at Preese Hall-1 and the wells at Grange Hill-1 and Becconsall-1. The Bowland basin epitomizes the challenges faced in developing European Shale gas. These include the strategies needed for developing thick geological sections using a relatively small surface footprint in a socially responsible and acceptable manner. The Cuadrilla strategy for this is centred on multilateral well pads and the geological workflows surrounding the associated technology. This includes detailed 3D understanding of the subsurface in terms of sedimentary architecture and the location of the most productive zones, the regional and local structure and the stress distribution in the subsurface, especially the location of critically stressed areas. In the presentation Cuadrilla will describe it's progress to date and outline strategies planned to unlock the resource potential of the Bowland Basin.},

@article{Weber1963,
abstract = {Laboratory investigations show that rates of adsorption of persistent organic compounds on granular carbon are quite low. Intraparticle diffusion of solute appears to control the rate of uptake, thus the rate is partially a function of the pore size distribution of the adsorbent, of the molecular size and configuration of the solute, and of the relative electrokinetic properties of adsorbate and adsorbent. Systemic factors such as temperature and pH will influence the rates of adsorption; rates increase with increasing temperature and decrease with increasing pH. The effect of initial concentration of solute is of considerable significance, the rate of uptake being a linear function of the square-root of concentration within the range of experimentation. Relative reaction rates also vary reciprocally with the square of the diameter of individual carbon particle for a given weight of carbon. Based on the findings of the research, fluidized-bed operation is suggested as an efficient means of using adsorption for treatment of waters and waste waters.},

Using the thermodynamic ideal-adsorbed-solution method, total and partial adsorptions are calculated for the bi-solute systems; agreement with experimental data is good. Prediction for total adsorption is within about 2-10{\%} and for adsorption of individual components within about 3-20{\%}. In the prediction calculations only single-solute data are used. A new three-parameter adsorption isotherm is presented. This new isotherm also represents the single-solute data well. For bi-solute systems where dissociation is negligible, calculated individual adsorptions agree with experiment within 2{\%}. Systematic deviations between calculated and observed results may be due to the acidities of the solutes. In the future, adsorption experiments should be done under controlled pH conditions. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {Adsorption is one of the most widely applied techniques for environmental remediation. Its kinetics are of great significance to evaluate the performance of a given adsorbent and gain insight into the underlying mechanisms. There are lots of references available concerning adsorption kinetics, and several mathematic models have been developed to describe adsorption reaction and diffusion processes. However, these models were frequently employed to fit the kinetic data in an unsuitable or improper manner. This is mainly because the boundary conditions of the associated models were, to a considerable extent, ignored for data modeling. Here we reviewed several widely-used adsorption kinetic models and paid more attention to their boundary conditions. We believe that the review is of certain significance and improvement for adsorption kinetic modeling.},

Simple examples are given in the following pages to illustrate the use of resistivity logs in the solution of some problems dealing with oil and gas reserviours. From the available information, it is apparent that much care must be exercised in applying to more complicated cases the methods suggested. It should be remembered that the equations given are not precise and represent only approximate relationships. It is believed, however, that under favourable conditions their application falls within useful limits of accuracy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider in detail the computer simulation of argon adsorption on a graphite surface and inside graphitic slit pores under supercritical conditions. Experimental results in the literature for graphitic adsorbents show that excess isotherms pass through a maximum and then become negative at high pressures (even for adsorption on open surfaces) when a helium void volume is used in the calculation of the excess amount. Here we show that, by using the appropriate accessible volume (which is smaller than the helium void volume), the excess isotherms still have a maximum but are always positive. The existence and the magnitude of this maximum is because the rate of change of the adsorbed density is equal to that of the bulk gas, which has a large change in bulk gas density for a small variation in pressure for temperatures not far above the critical point. However for temperatures far above T(c), this change in the bulk gas density is no longer significant and the maximum in the surface excess density becomes less pronounced and even disappears at high enough temperatures. The positivity of the adsorption excess persists for all pressures up to 10,000 atm for adsorption on surfaces and in slit pores of all sizes. For adsorption on a surface, the surface excess density eventually reaches a plateau at high pressures as expected, because the change in the adsorbed phase is comparable to that of the bulk gas. Positive excess lends support to our physical argument that the adsorbed phase is denser than the bulk gas, and this is logical as the forces exerted by the pore walls should aid to the compression of the adsorbed phase.},

abstract = {Variability in the Lower Bowland shale microstructure is investigated here, for the first time, from the centimetre to the micrometre scale using optical and scanning electron microscopy (OM, SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Total Organic Carbon content (TOC) measurements. A significant range of microtextures, organic-matter particles and fracture styles was observed in rocks of the Lower Bowland shale, together with the underlying Pendleside Limestone and Worston Shale formations encountered the Preese Hall-1 Borehole, Lancashire, UK. Four micro-texture types were identified: unlaminated quartz-rich mudstone; interlaminated quartz- and pyrite-rich mudstone; laminated quartz and pyrite-rich mudstone; and weakly-interlaminated calcite-rich mudstone. Organic matter particles are classified into four types depending on their size, shape and location: multi-micrometre particles with and without macropores: micrometre-size particles in cement and between clay minerals; multi-micrometre layers; and organic matter in large pores. Fractures are categorized into carbonate-sealed fractures; bitumen-bearing fractures; resin-filled fractures; and empty fractures. We propose that during thermal maturation, horizontal bitumen-fractures were formed by overpressuring, stress relaxation, compaction and erosional offloading, whereas vertical bitumen-bearing, resin-filled and empty fractures may have been influenced by weak vertical joints generated during the previous period of veining. For the majority of samples, the high TOC ({\textgreater}2 wt{\%}), low clay content ({\textless}20 wt{\%}), high proportion of quartz ({\textgreater}50 wt{\%}) and the presence of a multi-scale fracture network support the increasing interest in the Bowland Shale as a potentially exploitable oil and gas source. The microtextural observations made in this study highlight preliminary evidence of fluid passage or circulation in the Bowland Shale sequence during burial.},

abstract = {Henry Eyring's absolute rate theory explains the size of chemical reaction rate constants in terms of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and quantum chemistry. In addition it uses a number of unique concepts such as the ‘transition state'. A key feature of the theory is that the explanation it provides relies on the comparison of reaction rate constant expressions derived from these individual theories. In this paper, the example is used to develop a naturalized notion of reduction and the unity of science. This characterization provides the necessary clues to the sort of inter-theoretic linkages that are present in the theory of reaction rates. The overall theory is then further characterized as a theory network, establishing connections between non-reductive notions of inter-theory connections. This characterization also sheds new light on the unity of science.},

abstract = {Abstract In order to increase the oil recovery factor from depleted sandstone reservoirs with low degree of pressure, implementation of chemical flooding is the technically known as a feasible solution. The polymer-surfactant flooding, as one of the main subsets of chemical flooding methods, is a vigorous Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method which can be applied with a high level of performance in sandstone reservoirs. Applying the aforementioned technique is very often unfeasible due to the expensive chemical additives and surfactant loss in term of adsorption on the reservoir rock. This paper mainly deals with the adsorption behavior (both static and dynamic) of the natural surfactant, which extracted surfactant from leaves of Zyziphus Spina Christi, onto a real shale-sandstone reservoir samples. Furthermore, adsorption kinetics and equilibrium are determined to help the understanding of the adsorption mechanism. To examine the effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption efficiency, static adsorption experiments are performed. The effect of temperature on the kinetic and equilibrium of adsorption process was experimentally done. Finally, two core flooding experiments are carried out to determine the adsorption behavior in dynamic conditions. It was emerged that the Freundlich model has a more permissible fit for the adsorption equilibrium of natural surfactant after analyzing the related data for four models. Moreover, the laboratorial research about the adsorption kinetics proved statistically that pseudo-second order model prepares the best kinetics model for the natural surfactant.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a calculation procedure aimed at improving the accuracy and meaningfulness of high-pressure gas adsorption data obtained by either adsorption manometry or gravimetry. The procedure is based on the Gibbs model and avoids the usual simplifying assumption that the well-defined Gibbs dividing surface (the GDS) coincides with the ill-defined adsorptive-accessible surface of the microporous adsorbent. Instead, it makes a clear distinction between the two surfaces and introduces the concept of "Gibbs exclusion volume" (i.e. the volume enclosed by the GDS) which is shown to be central in the calculation of the surface excess amount and useful to avoid any confusion with the adsorbent volume. It is shown, in the case of methane adsorption on gas shale, how this procedure avoids introducing the uncertainty due to the dead volume determination in an inter-laboratory comparison. The conditions for a surface excess isotherm to be a useful intermediate step in the assessment of the amount adsorbed are stressed and illustrated.},

abstract = {Adsorption on a nonporous, nonswelling adsorbent and adsorption in micropores represent two limiting cases of physical adsorption which are dearly distinguishable thermodynamieMly. In the first ease, the chemical potential of the adsorbent is inde-pendent of the amount of the adsorbed substance; in the second ease, it varies with it. The works of Brunauer, which made a whole epoch in the theory of adsorption, belong to the first type of adsorption phenomena; adsorption in micropores, however, is beyond the framework of his investigations. It should be treated in terms of volume filling, and not of layer-by-layer coverage of the surface. In computational methods of the theory in hand, a substantial role is played by the concept of the temperature invarianee of free energy of adsorption as a function of the degree of filling. An analysis of this concept is given and the limits of its ap-plicability are assessed. Exact and approximate expressions for the calculation of the basic thermody-namic functions in adsorption in micropores have been obtained. A generaliT.ed thermal equation of adsorption, i.e., {\~{}}(0, p, T) = 0, applicable to the quantitative description of adsorption of molecules sharply differing in electronic structure on microporous adsorbents widely different in nature (active carbons, zeolites, etc.) is considered.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider in detail the computer simulation of argon adsorption on a graphite surface and inside graphitic slit pores under supercritical conditions. Experimental results in the literature for graphitic adsorbents show that excess isotherms pass through a maximum and then become negative at high pressures (even for adsorption on open surfaces) when a helium void volume is used in the calculation of the excess amount. Here we show that, by using the appropriate accessible volume (which is smaller than the helium void volume), the excess isotherms still have a maximum but are always positive. The existence and the magnitude of this maximum is because the rate of change of the adsorbed density is equal to that of the bulk gas, which has a large change in bulk gas density for a small variation in pressure for temperatures not far above the critical point. However for temperatures far above T(c), this change in the bulk gas density is no longer significant and the maximum in the surface excess density becomes less pronounced and even disappears at high enough temperatures. The positivity of the adsorption excess persists for all pressures up to 10,000 atm for adsorption on surfaces and in slit pores of all sizes. For adsorption on a surface, the surface excess density eventually reaches a plateau at high pressures as expected, because the change in the adsorbed phase is comparable to that of the bulk gas. Positive excess lends support to our physical argument that the adsorbed phase is denser than the bulk gas, and this is logical as the forces exerted by the pore walls should aid to the compression of the adsorbed phase.},

abstract = {A rapid method is presented for determination of the multi-component gas and water sorption isotherms on carbonaceous solids from the non-equilibrium sorption data. This approach alleviates the long-time data requirement of the traditional volumetric gas adsorption technique used to construct gas isotherms requiring a series of equilibrium sorption measurements by successive pressure increments, particularly resorted in the coalbed methane industry. This is accomplished by the application of the non-equilibrium thermodynamics, multi-component material balance, gas sorption, and dissolution kinetic considerations for the gas adsorbed by carbonaceous solids and the gas dissolved in water under the effect of pressure, temperature, and grain size. The capabilities of the new technique in reducing the time required for construction of an isotherm are demonstrated by analyzing a series of the non-equilibrium sorption measurements and projecting the results to the equilibrium case. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the present model enables constructing both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium multi-component gas and water sorption isotherms in any carbonaceous solids and particularly coals simultaneously in relatively shorter time and with higher accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Do2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we consider in detail the computer simulation of argon adsorption on a graphite surface and inside graphitic slit pores under supercritical conditions. Experimental results in the literature for graphitic adsorbents show that excess isotherms pass through a maximum and then become negative at high pressures (even for adsorption on open surfaces) when a helium void volume is used in the calculation of the excess amount. Here we show that, by using the appropriate accessible volume (which is smaller than the helium void volume), the excess isotherms still have a maximum but are always positive. The existence and the magnitude of this maximum is because the rate of change of the adsorbed density is equal to that of the bulk gas, which has a large change in bulk gas density for a small variation in pressure for temperatures not far above the critical point. However for temperatures far above T(c), this change in the bulk gas density is no longer significant and the maximum in the surface excess density becomes less pronounced and even disappears at high enough temperatures. The positivity of the adsorption excess persists for all pressures up to 10,000 atm for adsorption on surfaces and in slit pores of all sizes. For adsorption on a surface, the surface excess density eventually reaches a plateau at high pressures as expected, because the change in the adsorbed phase is comparable to that of the bulk gas. Positive excess lends support to our physical argument that the adsorbed phase is denser than the bulk gas, and this is logical as the forces exerted by the pore walls should aid to the compression of the adsorbed phase.},

abstract = {This perspectives article is intended highlight the growing importance and emergence of shale gas as an energy resource and as a source of chemicals. Over the next decades huge amounts of newly discovered deposits of trapped gas are expected to be produced not only in the USA but elsewhere providing a wealth of methane and ethane not only used for energy production, but also for conversion to lower hydrocarbon chemicals. This manuscript seeks to focus on the potential of trapped natural gas around the world. The potential new volumes of trapped gas within shale or other mineral strata coming to the marketplace offer a tremendous opportunity if scientists can invent new, cost effective ways to convert this methane to higher value chemicals. Understanding how to selectively break a single C-H bond in methane while minimizing methane conversion to CO2is critical. {\textcopyright} 2013, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

A comprehensive evaluation of the various methods proposed to apply potential theory to the adsorption data is presented. Temperature-independent characteristic curves for each adsorbate could be obtained if 1.(1) adsorbed phase molar volumes, necessary to obtain the characteristic curves, are evaluated by Dubinin's method and2.(2) if the adsorption potential is defined as RT ln(fsf), where fs was calculated from Ps = (TTc)2Pc. The Dubinin-Astakhov equation gave the most suitable representation of the data.},
