abstract = {Laboratory investigations show that rates of adsorption of persistent organic compounds on granular carbon are quite low. Intraparticle diffusion of solute appears to control the rate of uptake, thus the rate is partially a function of the pore size distribution of the adsorbent, of the molecular size and configuration of the solute, and of the relative electrokinetic properties of adsorbate and adsorbent. Systemic factors such as temperature and pH will influence the rates of adsorption; rates increase with increasing temperature and decrease with increasing pH. The effect of initial concentration of solute is of considerable significance, the rate of uptake being a linear function of the square-root of concentration within the range of experimentation. Relative reaction rates also vary reciprocally with the square of the diameter of individual carbon particle for a given weight of carbon. Based on the findings of the research, fluidized-bed operation is suggested as an efficient means of using adsorption for treatment of waters and waste waters.},

abstract = {Henry Eyring's absolute rate theory explains the size of chemical reaction rate constants in terms of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and quantum chemistry. In addition it uses a number of unique concepts such as the ‘transition state'. A key feature of the theory is that the explanation it provides relies on the comparison of reaction rate constant expressions derived from these individual theories. In this paper, the example is used to develop a naturalized notion of reduction and the unity of science. This characterization provides the necessary clues to the sort of inter-theoretic linkages that are present in the theory of reaction rates. The overall theory is then further characterized as a theory network, establishing connections between non-reductive notions of inter-theory connections. This characterization also sheds new light on the unity of science.},

@article{Fan2003a,
abstract = {Adsorption is one important technique in fluoride removal from aqueous solutions. The viability of adsorption techniques is greatly dependent on the development of adsorptive materials. A large number of materials have been tested at a fluoride concentration greater than 2mg/l, and the lowest limit for fluoride reduction by them is about 2mg/l. Decreasing the fluoride concentration to less than 2mg/l, most of the tested materials displayed a very low capacity of fluoride removal. This paper has concentrated on investigating the adsorption kinetics and adsorption capacity of low cost materials at a low initial fluoride concentration. The experiments were carried out at a natural pH, and radioisotope18F rather than19F was used since18F can be rapidly measured by measuring the radioactivity with a resolution of 1×10-13mg or 0.01$\mu$Ci. The tested materials are hydroxyapatite, fluorspar, calcite, quartz and quartz activated by ferric ions. Their adsorption capacities follow the order: Hydroxyapatite{\textgreater} Fluorspar{\textgreater}Quartz activated using ferric ions{\textgreater}Calcite{\textgreater}Quartz The uptake of fluoride on hydroxyapatite is an ion-exchange procedure and follows the pseudo-first- and second-order equations, while the uptake of fluoride on the others is a surface adsorption and follows the pseudo-second-order equation. Calcite has been seen as a good adsorbent in fluoride removal and has been patented. However, our data suggested that its adsorption capacity is only better than quartz. The external mass transfer is a very slow and rate-determining step during fluoride removal from the aqueous solution. Under static conditions, there was no relative movement between adsorbents and solutions, the fluoride uptake was at a very slow rate and the adsorbent properties did not significantly affect the fluoride uptake. Under shaken conditions, the adsorption of fluoride was controlled by the adsorbent structure and chemical properties. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Bowland Basin is a key part of the Pennine Carboniferous Petroleum system is calculated to have significant shale gas resource potential with over 200 TCF OGIP The basin is one of a number of linked, Lower Carboniferous trans-tensional basins characterized by thick accumulations of hemi-pelagic calcareous mudstones and related facies. In Bowland there is up to 2000m of gas saturated section comprising the Hodder, Lower Bowland and Upper Bowland Shale Formations. This paper will describe the results of recent exploration activity by Cuadrilla Resources Ltd between 2010 and 2012. These include the gas discovery well at Preese Hall-1 and the wells at Grange Hill-1 and Becconsall-1. The Bowland basin epitomizes the challenges faced in developing European Shale gas. These include the strategies needed for developing thick geological sections using a relatively small surface footprint in a socially responsible and acceptable manner. The Cuadrilla strategy for this is centred on multilateral well pads and the geological workflows surrounding the associated technology. This includes detailed 3D understanding of the subsurface in terms of sedimentary architecture and the location of the most productive zones, the regional and local structure and the stress distribution in the subsurface, especially the location of critically stressed areas. In the presentation Cuadrilla will describe it's progress to date and outline strategies planned to unlock the resource potential of the Bowland Basin.},

abstract = {Experimental adsorption data at 20°C are given for six dilute aqueous bi-solute systems adsorbing on activated carbon. The three-parameter Toth adsorption isotherm gives good representation of the data for aqueous single-solute adsorption. Using the thermodynamic ideal-adsorbed-solution method, total and partial adsorptions are calculated for the bi-solute systems; agreement with experimental data is good. Prediction for total adsorption is within about 2-10{\%} and for adsorption of individual components within about 3-20{\%}. In the prediction calculations only single-solute data are used. A new three-parameter adsorption isotherm is presented. This new isotherm also represents the single-solute data well. For bi-solute systems where dissociation is negligible, calculated individual adsorptions agree with experiment within 2{\%}. Systematic deviations between calculated and observed results may be due to the acidities of the solutes. In the future, adsorption experiments should be done under controlled pH conditions. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {Adsorption is one of the most widely applied techniques for environmental remediation. Its kinetics are of great significance to evaluate the performance of a given adsorbent and gain insight into the underlying mechanisms. There are lots of references available concerning adsorption kinetics, and several mathematic models have been developed to describe adsorption reaction and diffusion processes. However, these models were frequently employed to fit the kinetic data in an unsuitable or improper manner. This is mainly because the boundary conditions of the associated models were, to a considerable extent, ignored for data modeling. Here we reviewed several widely-used adsorption kinetic models and paid more attention to their boundary conditions. We believe that the review is of certain significance and improvement for adsorption kinetic modeling.},

@article{Do2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we consider in detail the computer simulation of argon adsorption on a graphite surface and inside graphitic slit pores under supercritical conditions. Experimental results in the literature for graphitic adsorbents show that excess isotherms pass through a maximum and then become negative at high pressures (even for adsorption on open surfaces) when a helium void volume is used in the calculation of the excess amount. Here we show that, by using the appropriate accessible volume (which is smaller than the helium void volume), the excess isotherms still have a maximum but are always positive. The existence and the magnitude of this maximum is because the rate of change of the adsorbed density is equal to that of the bulk gas, which has a large change in bulk gas density for a small variation in pressure for temperatures not far above the critical point. However for temperatures far above T(c), this change in the bulk gas density is no longer significant and the maximum in the surface excess density becomes less pronounced and even disappears at high enough temperatures. The positivity of the adsorption excess persists for all pressures up to 10,000 atm for adsorption on surfaces and in slit pores of all sizes. For adsorption on a surface, the surface excess density eventually reaches a plateau at high pressures as expected, because the change in the adsorbed phase is comparable to that of the bulk gas. Positive excess lends support to our physical argument that the adsorbed phase is denser than the bulk gas, and this is logical as the forces exerted by the pore walls should aid to the compression of the adsorbed phase.},

abstract = {A rapid method is presented for determination of the multi-component gas and water sorption isotherms on carbonaceous solids from the non-equilibrium sorption data. This approach alleviates the long-time data requirement of the traditional volumetric gas adsorption technique used to construct gas isotherms requiring a series of equilibrium sorption measurements by successive pressure increments, particularly resorted in the coalbed methane industry. This is accomplished by the application of the non-equilibrium thermodynamics, multi-component material balance, gas sorption, and dissolution kinetic considerations for the gas adsorbed by carbonaceous solids and the gas dissolved in water under the effect of pressure, temperature, and grain size. The capabilities of the new technique in reducing the time required for construction of an isotherm are demonstrated by analyzing a series of the non-equilibrium sorption measurements and projecting the results to the equilibrium case. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the present model enables constructing both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium multi-component gas and water sorption isotherms in any carbonaceous solids and particularly coals simultaneously in relatively shorter time and with higher accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
