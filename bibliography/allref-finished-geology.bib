abstract = {Marine shales were deposited in a complex series of tectonically active basins across central Britain during the Visean and Namurian epochs of the Carboniferous (c.347-318 Ma). In all of these basins, deep-water marine shales pass laterally into shallow-water shelf limestones and deltaic sandstones. Contemporary basins extend offshore beneath the East Irish Sea and the Southern North Sea. The marine shales attain thicknesses of up to 16,000 ft (5000 m) in basin depocentres (i.e. the Bowland, Blacon, Gainsborough, Widmerpool, Edale and Cleveland basins), and they contain sufficient organic matter to generate considerable amounts of hydrocarbons. Conventional oil and gas fields around most of these basins attest to their capability to produce hydrocarbons. The organic content of the Bowland-Hodder shales is typically in the range 1-3{\%}, but can reach 8{\%}. The maturity of the Bowland-Hodder shales is a function of burial depth, heat flow and time, but subsequent uplift complicates this analysis. Where they have been buried to sufficient depth for the organic material to generate gas, the Bowland-Hodder shales have the potential to form a shale gas resource.},

abstract = {Matrix-related pore networks in mudrocks are composed of nanometer- to micrometer-size pores. In shale-gas systems, these pores, along with natural fractures, form the flow-path (permeability) network that allows flow of gas from the mudrock to induced fractures during production. A pore classification consisting of three majormatrix-related pore types is presented that can be used to quantify matrix-related pores and relate them to pore networks. Two pore types are associated with the mineral matrix; the third pore type is associated with organic matter (OM). Fracture pores are not controlled by individual matrix particles and are not part of this classification. Pores associated with mineral particles can be subdivided into interparticle (interP) pores that are found between particles and crystals and intraparticle (intraP) pores that are located within particles. Organic-matter pores are intraP pores located within OM. Interparticle mineral pores have a higher probability of being part of an effective pore network than intraP mineral pores because they are more likely to be interconnected. Although they are intraP, OM pores are also likely to be part of an interconnected network because of the interconnectivity of OM particles. In unlithifed near-surface muds, pores consist of interP and intraP pores, and as the muds are buried, they compact and lithify. During the compaction process, a large number of interP and intraP pores are destroyed, especially in ductile grainrich muds. Compaction can decrease the pore volume up to 88{\%} by several kilometers of burial. At the onset of hydrocarbon thermal maturation, OM pores are created in kerogen. At depth, dissolution of chemically unstable particles can create additional moldic intraP pores},

abstract = {The Bowland Basin is a key part of the Pennine Carboniferous Petroleum system is calculated to have significant shale gas resource potential with over 200 TCF OGIP The basin is one of a number of linked, Lower Carboniferous trans-tensional basins characterized by thick accumulations of hemi-pelagic calcareous mudstones and related facies. In Bowland there is up to 2000m of gas saturated section comprising the Hodder, Lower Bowland and Upper Bowland Shale Formations. This paper will describe the results of recent exploration activity by Cuadrilla Resources Ltd between 2010 and 2012. These include the gas discovery well at Preese Hall-1 and the wells at Grange Hill-1 and Becconsall-1. The Bowland basin epitomizes the challenges faced in developing European Shale gas. These include the strategies needed for developing thick geological sections using a relatively small surface footprint in a socially responsible and acceptable manner. The Cuadrilla strategy for this is centred on multilateral well pads and the geological workflows surrounding the associated technology. This includes detailed 3D understanding of the subsurface in terms of sedimentary architecture and the location of the most productive zones, the regional and local structure and the stress distribution in the subsurface, especially the location of critically stressed areas. In the presentation Cuadrilla will describe it's progress to date and outline strategies planned to unlock the resource potential of the Bowland Basin.},

abstract = {Variability in the Lower Bowland shale microstructure is investigated here, for the first time, from the centimetre to the micrometre scale using optical and scanning electron microscopy (OM, SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Total Organic Carbon content (TOC) measurements. A significant range of microtextures, organic-matter particles and fracture styles was observed in rocks of the Lower Bowland shale, together with the underlying Pendleside Limestone and Worston Shale formations encountered the Preese Hall-1 Borehole, Lancashire, UK. Four micro-texture types were identified: unlaminated quartz-rich mudstone; interlaminated quartz- and pyrite-rich mudstone; laminated quartz and pyrite-rich mudstone; and weakly-interlaminated calcite-rich mudstone. Organic matter particles are classified into four types depending on their size, shape and location: multi-micrometre particles with and without macropores: micrometre-size particles in cement and between clay minerals; multi-micrometre layers; and organic matter in large pores. Fractures are categorized into carbonate-sealed fractures; bitumen-bearing fractures; resin-filled fractures; and empty fractures. We propose that during thermal maturation, horizontal bitumen-fractures were formed by overpressuring, stress relaxation, compaction and erosional offloading, whereas vertical bitumen-bearing, resin-filled and empty fractures may have been influenced by weak vertical joints generated during the previous period of veining. For the majority of samples, the high TOC ({\textgreater}2 wt{\%}), low clay content ({\textless}20 wt{\%}), high proportion of quartz ({\textgreater}50 wt{\%}) and the presence of a multi-scale fracture network support the increasing interest in the Bowland Shale as a potentially exploitable oil and gas source. The microtextural observations made in this study highlight preliminary evidence of fluid passage or circulation in the Bowland Shale sequence during burial.},
