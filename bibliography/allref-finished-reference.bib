@article{Lide2003,
abstract = {Researchers around the world depend upon having access to authoritative, up-to-date data. And for 90 years, they have relied on the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics for that data. This year is no exception. New tables, extensive updates, and added sections mean the Handbook has again set a new standard for reliability, utility, and thoroughness. This edition features a completely new table of Physical Constants of Organic Compounds with data on almost 11,000 compounds, new structure diagrams, and a new, more convenient format. Reflecting CRC's dedication to ensuring the Handbook remains current, this edition also incorporates new entries and data from the U.S. Government's just-released "Tenth Report on Carcinogens."},
