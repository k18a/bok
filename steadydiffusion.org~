#+TITLE: Steady Diffusion Accross Thin Film

* Steady Diffusion Across Thin Film
- mathematically straightforward but with very important consequences for diffusion
  
- consider a thin film of thickness l, containing well-mixed solutions on each side of different concentrations
- [[./steadydiffusionthinfilm.jpg]]
- the first step is always to write a mass balance
- mass balance accross a thin section \Delta z, z units of distance from the lseft side of the film
  - accumulation = rate of diffusion into layer at z - rate of diffusion out of layer at (z + \Delta z)
- at steady state accumulation is 0
  - $0 = A(J_z - J_{(z + \Delta z)})$
  - J is the flux
  - A is area
  - z is distance
- at very small \Delta z
  - $0 = - \frac{d}{dz}J$
- Fick's First Law
  - $J = D \frac{d C}{dz}$
- differentiating Fick's first law for a constant D
  - $0 = D \frac{d^2 C}{d z^2}$
- boundary conditions
  - at $z = 0, C = C_{0}$
  - at $z = l, C = C_{l}$
- solution to the differential equation is of the form
  - $C = a + b z$
- integrating with the given boundary conditions
  - $C = C_{0} + (C_{l} - C_{0})\frac{z}{l}$
- as expected concentration varies linearly with distance as shown in the figure
- as the system is in steady state, flux is constant
  - $j = -D \frac{dC}{dz} = \frac{D}{l} (C_{0} - C_{l})$
 

* Steady Diffusion Across Membrane
- treatment is similar but with different boundary conditions
- mass balance accross a thin section \Delta z, z units of distance from the lseft side of the film
  - accumulation = rate of diffusion into layer at z - rate of diffusion out of layer at z + \Delta z
- at steady state accumulation is 0
  - $0 = A(J_z - J_{(z + \Delta z)})$
- at very small \Delta z
  - $0 = - \frac{d}{dz}J$
- Fick's First Law
  - $J = D \frac{d C}{dz}$
- differentiating Fick's first law for a constant D
  - $0 = D \frac{d^2 C}{d z^2}$
- boundary conditions
  - at $z = 0, C = HC_{0}$
  - at $z = l, C = HC_{l}$
    - H is the partition coefficient
      - concentration in the membrane / concentration in the adjacent solution
- solution to the differential equation is of the form
  - $C = a + b z$
- integrating with the given boundary conditions
  - $C = HC_{0} + H(C_{l} - C_{0})\frac{z}{l}$
- as expected concentration varies linearly with distance as shown in the figure
- as the system is in steady state, flux is constant
  - $j = -D \frac{dC}{dz} = \frac{D}{l} (C_{0} - C_{l})$
- unless the partition coefficient is 1, this implies that there will be discontinuities in the system, although the concentration profile is still linear
- the figure below shows the concentration profiles for H > 1, H < 1, and the chemical potentials
- thinking about chemical potential is helpful as solute travels from a region of higher chemical potential to a region of lower chemical potential

** In the presence of Chemical Reactions
- if the diffusing solute 1 can rapidly and reversibly react with other immobile solutes fixed withing the membrane
- mass balance of solute 1 in section z to z+\Delta z is now given by
  - accumulation = rate of diffusion into layer at z - rate of diffusion out of layer at (z + \Delta z) + amount produced/consumed by chemical reaction
- at steady state accumulation is 0
  - $0 = A(J _1 _z - J _1 _{(z + \Delta z)}) - r_1 A \Delta z$
  - r1 is rate constant of the chemical reaction involving solute 1
  - A \Delta z is the volume of the section
- differentiating
  - $0 = -\frac{d}{dz} j_1 - r_1$
- for the immobile solute which is involved in the same reaction
  - $0 = -\frac{d}{dz} j_2 - r_1$
  - since the product is immobile, flux, J is 0
  - \therfore r_1 is 0
- the derivation reverts to that of steady diffusion in membranes without chemical reaction
- therefore chemical reaction with an immobile species does not affect diffusion profile in case of steady state diffusion
  - this is an unsual case as in almost every other case, chemical reaction dramatically alters mass transfer

* Steady Diffusion with Concentration Dependent Diffusion Coefficient
- treatment remains same but with boundary conditions
  - $z = 0, C_1 = C_{1 0}$
  - $z = l, C_1 = C_{1 l}$
- $C_1 = C_{10} (1-\frac{z}{l})^{1/2}$
- combined with Fick's laws
  - $J = -D \frac{dC_1}{dz}
  - = -\frac{D_0 C_1}}{c_{10}}\frac{dc_1}{dz}
  - = \frac{D_0 C_{10}
