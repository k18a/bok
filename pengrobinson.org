* Peng-Robinson Equation of State

$P = \frac{RT}{V_m - b} - \frac{a \alpha}{V _m ^2 + 2 v V_m - b ^2}$

Equation constants are defined as,

$a = \frac{0.457235 R^2 T _c ^2}{P_c}$

$b = \frac{0.077796 R T_c}{P_c}$

$\alpha = (1 + \kappa (1 - T _r ^{1/2}) )^2$ 

$\kappa= 0.37464 + 1.54223 \omega - 0.23992 \omega ^2$

$\omega$ is the acentric factor given by,

$\omega = \frac{P _{sat}}{P_c}$

- P is pressure
- R is gas constant
- Vm is molar volume
- Psat is saturated vapour pressure
- Pc is critical pressure
