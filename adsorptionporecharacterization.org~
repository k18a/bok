* Pore Characterization Based on Gas Adsorption

- [[file:bet.org][BET Theory]] is used to derive surface area from physisorption data as a standard practice irrespective of whether the surface of the adsorbent complies with BET theory cite:Sing1985
- Due to the limitations of BET theory, the fitting constant must be relatively high ($C>100$), as lower values of C is associated with an appreciable overlap of monolayer and multilayer adsorption cite:Sing1985

- A residual pressure of $10^{-4} Torr$ is considered acceptable in the case of for the case of pore-size-distribution characterization cite:Sing1985


At lower relative pressures, ($p/p_0<0.3$) linear plot is obtained between $\frac{p}{{n^a}({p^0}-p)}$ and $\frac{p}{p^0}$, which allows us to obtain the monolayer adsorption capacity, $n_m^a$. The BET SSA is calculated from the monolayer capacity as: $SSA_{BET}={{n_m^a}.L.{a_m}}/{w}$ @Sing1985. 
w is the sample weight
L is the Avogadro constant
$a_m$ is the average cross-sectional area occupied by a single molecule; $a_m(N_2)=0.162{nm^2}$ @Sing1985

It is now widely recognized that the limitations of the BET theory, render in unsuitable for microporous substances @Sing1985. No analogous standard such as the BET SSA exists for microporous substances @Sing1985. The potential theory of adsorption is used to calculate pore characteristics for microporous substances. If multilayer adsorption exists, the finite slope of the isotherm beyond micropore capacity must be accounted for during pore characterization @Sing1985.

Capillary condensation theory at an intermediate pressure range is applied to N2 isotherms to characterize mesopores @Sing1985. Most methods that have been proposed to characterize mesopores from N2 adsorption data are based on the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) procedure @Sing1985.
